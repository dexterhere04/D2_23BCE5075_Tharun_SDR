Transform 2D architectural blueprints into interactive 3D models and generate precise 2D floor plans from natural language descriptions.

Core framework for converting 2D architectural blueprints (JPG, PNG, 
PDF) to 3D models (OBJ, GLTF, FBX) and generating 2D floor plans from 
text descriptions.




Next Steps




1. Implement blueprint element detection (OpenCV, Mask R-CNN)




2. Develop 2D-to-3D reconstruction pipeline




3. Build text parsing and floor plan generation




4. Integrate 3D preview with Three.js




5. Add model training scripts and pre-trained weights




6. Tech stack: Python 3.8+, PyTorch, OpenCV, Blender API, Gradio.
